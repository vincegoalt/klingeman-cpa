        question: 'How much can I contribute to retirement accounts?',
        answer: 'For 2024, you can contribute $23,000 to a 401(k) ($30,500 if 50+), and $7,000 to an IRA ($8,000 if 50+). Self-employed individuals may contribute up to $69,000 to a Solo 401(k). We help maximize contributions within IRS limits.'

      {
        question: 'Should I do a Roth conversion?',
        answer: 'Roth conversions can be beneficial if you expect higher future tax rates or want tax-free growth. The decision depends on your current tax bracket, retirement timeline, and estate planning goals. We analyze whether and when conversions make sense for you.'

        question: 'What retirement plan is best for small business owners?',
        answer: 'Options include SEP-IRA, SIMPLE IRA, Solo 401(k), or defined benefit plans. Solo 401(k)s often provide the highest contribution limits for owner-only businesses. We help choose and implement the best plan for your situation.'
