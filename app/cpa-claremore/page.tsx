              As the county seat of Rogers County, Claremore is a vibrant community with a rich history and a growing
              economy. With a population of approximately 19,000 residents, Claremore is home to a diverse mix of
              families, professionals, educators, and business owners who deserve professional CPA services tailored

              Whether you're a Rogers State University employee, a healthcare professional at one of Claremore's
              medical facilities, a retail business owner on Will Rogers Boulevard, or a homeowner planning for
              retirement, our experienced team understands the financial challenges and opportunities specific to
              the Claremore area. Our founder's background as a former IRS manager provides clients with insider
              knowledge that maximizes tax savings while ensuring complete compliance with federal and state regulations.

              Comprehensive CPA Services for Claremore Businesses and Residents
            </h3>

            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
              Claremore's economy is anchored by education, healthcare, retail, and government services. Rogers State
              University is one of the city's largest employers, while healthcare facilities including Claremore Indian
              Hospital and various medical clinics serve the region's healthcare needs. The historic downtown district
              features unique retail shops, restaurants, and service businesses that contribute to the local economy.
              Our CPA firm has extensive experience working with businesses and individuals across all these sectors.
            </p>

            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
              For Claremore business owners, we provide complete accounting solutions including business tax preparation,
              bookkeeping services, payroll management, and QuickBooks setup and training. We help retail shops manage
              inventory accounting, assist healthcare professionals with medical practice accounting, and guide service
              businesses through entity selection and tax planning strategies. Our business clients appreciate our
              proactive approach to identifying tax deductions and ensuring accurate financial records throughout the year.
            </p>

            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
              Individual tax preparation is another core service we provide to Claremore residents. Whether you're a
              university professor with educator expenses, a healthcare worker with continuing education costs, a retiree
              managing investment income, or a young professional buying your first home, we ensure you take advantage
              of every available deduction and credit. Our personalized approach means we take time to understand your
              unique financial situation and develop tax strategies that minimize your liability while keeping you
              compliant with IRS requirements.
            </p>

              Why Claremore Clients Choose Klingeman CPAs
            </h3>

            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
              Location and accessibility matter when choosing a CPA. While our office is in Tulsa, we're just 30 minutes
              from Claremore via US-66 or State Highway 20, making in-person consultations convenient when needed.
              However, we also leverage technology to serve clients efficiently through secure online portals, video
              conferencing, and electronic document exchange. Many of our Claremore clients appreciate the flexibility
              of working remotely while knowing they can visit our office for face-to-face meetings when preferred.
            </p>

            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
              What truly sets us apart is our commitment to building long-term relationships with every client. Unlike
              large national firms where you're just an account number, we provide personalized attention from experienced
              professionals who remember your name, understand your goals, and proactively communicate throughout the
              year. Our founder's former IRS experience gives clients confidence that their tax returns are prepared
              correctly and their audit risk is minimized. We've maintained a 100% success rate in IRS audit representation,
              demonstrating our expertise and attention to detail.

                  We offer both options based on your preference. Many Claremore clients work with us entirely remotely
                  using our secure online portal, video conferencing, and electronic document exchange. However, if you
                  prefer in-person meetings, our Tulsa office is just 30 minutes away and we're happy to schedule

                <p className="text-gray-700">
                  Our founder's experience as a former IRS manager provides invaluable insider knowledge about how the
                  IRS operates, what triggers audits, and how to structure your finances to minimize tax liability while
                  staying compliant. We know exactly what the IRS looks for during examinations, which helps us prepare
                  audit-proof tax returns. If you do receive an IRS notice, we can represent you confidently, having
                  maintained a 100% success rate in audit representation.

                </h3>
                <p className="text-gray-700">
                  Unlike large impersonal firms, we provide personalized attention and build long-term relationships with
                  every client. You'll work directly with experienced CPAs who remember your name and understand your
                  financial goals. We're proactive about communication, reaching out throughout the year with tax-saving
                  strategies rather than just at tax time. Our combination of technical expertise, former IRS experience,
                  and personal service creates an unmatched client experience for Claremore residents and businesses.

                  Can you help with both personal and business taxes?
                </h3>
                <p className="text-gray-700">
                  Absolutely. Many of our Claremore clients are business owners who need both personal and business tax
                  services. We provide comprehensive solutions including business entity selection, business tax returns,
                  bookkeeping, payroll, personal tax preparation, and tax planning that optimizes both your business and
                  personal tax situation. We look at your complete financial picture to develop strategies that minimize
                  your overall tax burden while helping you achieve your business and personal financial goals.

                </h3>
                <p className="text-gray-700">
                  While we can certainly help during tax season, the best time to contact us is well before April.
                  Proactive tax planning throughout the year allows us to implement strategies that reduce your tax
                  liability before year-end. For new clients, we recommend reaching out in the fall to discuss year-end
                  planning, or immediately if you're starting a new business, facing an IRS audit, or experiencing a
                  major life change. That said, we're here to help Claremore residents year-round, so contact us whenever
                  you need professional CPA services.
